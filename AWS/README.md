# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Core Services – Brief Overview

* **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

  * Virtual servers in the cloud.
  * Provides scalable compute capacity.
  * Can run applications, host websites, perform batch processing.
  * Supports different instance types optimized for CPU, memory, storage, or GPU.

* **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

  * Object storage for files, images, videos, backups.
  * Highly durable and scalable.
  * Provides lifecycle management, versioning, encryption, and access controls.

* **Lambda**

  * Serverless compute service.
  * Runs code in response to events without provisioning servers.
  * Pay-per-use model.

* **DynamoDB**

  * Managed NoSQL database.
  * Key-value and document data model.
  * Low-latency, scalable, fully managed.

* **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

  * Controls access to AWS resources.
  * Allows creation of users, groups, roles, and policies.
  * Enables fine-grained permission management.

* **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**

  * Pub/Sub messaging service.
  * Sends notifications to subscribers via SMS, email, or HTTP endpoints.

* **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**

  * Fully managed message queue.
  * Decouples application components.
  * Supports reliable message delivery with FIFO or standard queues.

* **CloudWatch**

  * Monitoring and observability service.
  * Collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources.
  * Enables alerts, dashboards, and automated responses.

* **RDS (Relational Database Service)**

  * Managed relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server).
  * Handles backups, patching, scaling, and replication.

* **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**

  * Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
  * Improves fault tolerance and scalability.

* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

  * Isolated network environment in AWS.
  * Allows control over IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and security groups.

This set of services represents the core building blocks for most cloud-based applications on AWS.
